- Fix bug with tunnel src/dst matches in Ryu rest API - low priority
- Use pylint to enhance python style
- Add Rest API to datarepository - Use update_policy / update_subscriber to contact remote Policy Database, maintaining current API of datarepository
- Use message.find_rrset() functions in dnspython for obtaining records from message section
- Add mode selector for RGW or CES (DNS functions needs to be changed)
- Add packet policy history to PBRA
- Verisign open DNS servers (64.6.64.6 and 64.6.65.6) produces case insensitive resolutions, e.g. TESt202.gWA.CeSprOtO.re2EE.ORg.



TODO:
 - Make own box for LXC ?
 - Use overlay rootfs ?
 - replace SSL cert with *.demo ?
    -> Only useful if we plan to add a 3rd GW branch ? Then reconfigure all nginx sites accordingly...
 - Add tmux for lxc environment
 - where is suricata used?
 - remove msisdn from host IDs ?
 - PBRA: initial reputation? what happens when you do nothing, how does the next metering interval evolve?
        -> code changes introduced reputation=0 by default.
 - How are we tracking ECS/ECID reputation of the server/host when a connection is accepted/expired?
 - Implement ECS/NCID support when creating a connection -> decouple DNS resolutions vs DATA allocation
 - Name Client Identifier - NCI (in paper) fix name of EDNS0 extensions in code!
 - Fix txqueuelen with LXC interfaces. Add script to runatstart.d to list the interfaces, skip lo and set the len?
      -> add post-ups in Vagrantfile for NICs in HOST machine
 - Add to readme the onelines for time sleep operations and the python snippet?
 - Change PBRA test suite to account for the delay introduced via packet mark! Explain how to pre-provision


TEST KPIs:
   - Compare the difference in serviceability when using base/ext1/ext2 with DNS noise
      - Argue that SLA is required to trust EDNS0 that track the clients
      - This requires some changes in code but will help us compare _trusted_ vs _untrusted_ DNS servers.
